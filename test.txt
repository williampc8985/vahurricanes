this is a test
instructions for working GITHUB projects with Dr. Weiss
0. in order to add to a file, you must press the i command to insert.
1. Before any work is done, be sure to run the "git pull" command from the 
directory, in this case, the vahurricanes dir. to leave VIM use " esc:wq"
2. After making the changes and using esc :wq, you are then out of the VIM editor for the file,
 then check the git status command. The files in red have been changed, but not updated.
3. The next step is the "git commit" command using git commit -am "a message" will update the work
 on the file.
4. Finally, the " git push" command will allow for these changes to be reflected
5. this is the workflow for this project, be sure to use git pull before starting any work, and use
 git push at the end, commit all work whenever stopping, so that is does not get lost. Never upload
 data to GH, as it was designed for exchanging code, and not data.
